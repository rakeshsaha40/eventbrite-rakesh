## Starter code for simple MVC Node.js class project

This is a minimal [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
application that shows very basic "model view controller"
structure and form handling.

What are all these files, you ask? Below you'll find a description of each one - hopefully this will help you get started.

* `app.js` - This file creates the [express](http://expressjs.com/)
  application and exports it.
* `server.js` - this is your server code. The server runs the
  application created in `app.js`. We seperate the "server" from the
  "app" because it helps with testing. Also, in theory, a server could
  have multiple apps.
* `controllers/` - this directory contains our "controllers" or
  "handlers", functions that take an HTTP request and write to the
  HTTP response. It is common practice to separate your controllers
  into different files based on what part of the application they're
  handling. In this case, we've separated out the controllers for the
  index page and the attendees page. The controllers
  defined in this directory are imported ("required") by our
  `app.js` file.
* `models/` - it is common practice to put your data storage into
  "models"---pieces of code that "model" the structure of the data
  upon which your application depends. In this case, we have just one
  model file and it stores only a list of names. Usually, our models
  would be "wired up" to a database, but that's not the case here---we're
  just storing our data in javascript. The models defined in this
  directory are imported ("required") by our controllers.
* `views/` - these are the "templates" or "views" for our application.
  These are usually HTML, but with another "templating language"
  thrown in so that we can generate different HTML given different
  data, like a mail merge. (There are many templating languages; we're
  using "nunjucks".) The controller typically gathers the data needed
  for an HTTP response, and renders the view using these data. (The
  data are often called "context data".) The views defined in this
  directly are referred to in our controllers.
* `package.json` - this is Node's configuration file for your
  project.  Inside you'll find information about the project, along
  with a list of dependencies (like Express) that you can install
  into `node_modules/` with `npm install`.
* `node_modules/` - the folder containing all of your dependencies.
  Usually you don't need to do anything to it, but if your app is
  misbehaving, sometimes removing and reinstalling `node_modules/`
  by running `rm -rf node_modules/` and `npm install` 
  will fix it. Though, you really shouldn't need to do that.
* `package-lock.json` - this describes the exact state of your
  `node_modules/` tree (the files in `node_modules`)
  without uploading the tree itself (all those hundreds
  of files). npm
  modules are always being
  updated, so this allows you to know exactly what you're running and
  standardize this across installations.
* `.gitignore` - this tells Git which files and folders to ignore --
  for example, you don't want to push `node_modules/` to GitHub.
* `Procfile` - this is how you tell Heroku how to run your code. You
  shouldn't need to mess with this one.
* `.eslintrc.json` - this is where we customize the rules for how
  your code gets linted (checked for style/errors) - most of them
  come from the `eslint-config-airbnb-base` package. You also shouldn't
  need to modify this file. If you're working on cloud9, their built-in
  editor will automatically use your eslint configuration. If you're
  working in another editor, it will depend on your setup.
* `*.test.js` - these are example tests that I wrote so you can follow my 
  example. This set of tests is not used for grading. Instead, they are 
  tests you write to help yourself. When you write a new function, you 
  should write a test to verify that function behaves with the manner
  you think it ought. Run your tests with `npm test`. The tests use
  Facebook's [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started)
  testing framework.
* `README.md` - this file :)

## Installing dependencies

To install dependencies, run `npm install`.


## Running the code

To run this application in a development environment, use the command
`npm run dev`.  That will run the "dev" script defined in `package.json`,
which itself runs [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon). Nodemon
will automatically restart your application when it detects changes
to your code. Each time it restarts your application it will run
[ESLint](https://eslint.org) on your code first to detect common
problems and enforce the JavaScript style specified in your
`.eslintrc.json` file.


In production, you should start the app with `npm start` or
`npm start`. On Heroku, this will happen by default, in the absense
of a Procfile because Heroku will detect that you're running a
[node](https://nodejs.org/en/) application based on the kinds
of files in your repo.
